# Del_Ban_Kick_Bot
Bot designed to delete, ban and kick a user (intentionally designed for Bot-Spammers) after a message has been sent into a specific channel of choice (ban-channel for eg).
Designed for UofA CompE Club discord server 


(still creating command functionality to allow for an allowable discord member [server owner, admin or other] to specify which channel to label as the 'ban-channel'; for now, because this was deisgned with the CompE Club in mind, message.channel.id has been hard-set)
