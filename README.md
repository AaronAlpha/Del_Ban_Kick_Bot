# Del_Ban_Kick_Bot
## Purposes
Bot designed to delete, ban and kick a user (intentionally designed for Bot-Spammers) after a message has been sent into a specific channel of choice (ban-channel for eg).
Designed for UofA CompE Club discord server (Jan-Feb 2026)

(still creating command functionality to allow for an allowable discord member [server owner, admin or other] to specify which channel to label as the 'ban-channel'; for now, because this was deisgned with the CompE Club in mind, message.channel.id has been hard-set)

### Ackowledgment of use of ChatGPT
I would like to say that I don't 'like' ChatGPT for cases of breach of Academic Inegrity or misrepresentaiton of work conducted by an individual. 
However, in development of this bot, there were moments where the Documentation and Tutorial Videos were: irrelevant; not enough; vague; unclear on how to use certain code; and many other related feelings of helplessness. 
Thus, to help myself _finish_ the code rather than be _not finish the code_ and be zero-tolerant-AI-usage: there were moments where I copy-pasted MY code onto ChatGPT and asked about the correctness of the code and/or why it was incorrect, and solutions to it.
I would've used the solution ideas/code **segments** provided by ChatGPT (and Google's automatically generated AI), BUT **did not prompt and use generated code from ChatGPT or any other AI model**

Thank you.
